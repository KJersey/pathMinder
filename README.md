# PathMinder
*â€” You Find the **Path**, we **Mind** the Math*

---

PathMinder is an open source utility for managing
inventory and other tedious tasks such as XP and loot generation in a tRPG.

While currently only built for the Pathfinder 1<sup>st</sup> Edition system,
it is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind.

PathMinder is currently in Alpha development and is by no means complete;
There are no guaranties that any existing source code or API's will remain unchanged.
Feel free to give the source a dive and contribute.
